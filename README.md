# README #

Start with the bigextractscript.m file. This is the file that finds and organizes all of the data I took for the density paper project. The script as it stands references the locations of the data as they were when the density paper was published. I will be moving the data off the computer shortly, so the path names will no longer work. I intend to update this readme with the correct locations. The folder names should remain intact even if the path name changes.

In bigextractscript, there are calls to different functions (e.g. extractalldata, extractalldata_heterokaryon, etc). All of these functions are found in the LittleExtractScripts folder within the densitypaper folder.

All of the software used to do anything is in the SoftwareFreeze folder in the densitypaper folder. The volume code is in "VOLUME CODE NEW". A new version of the volume code is up on the bitbucket, and it works with new image objects.

The software freeze is also in the bitbucket folder densitypaperdataanalysis
